# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to classify iris flower species using the Iris dataset. 
It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction with visualizations of the classification outcomes.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: Loading and exploring the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values (if any), encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Building**: Constructing a machine learning model using Logistic Regression, along with tuning hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Plotting pairplots and confusion matrices for a visual understanding of feature relationships and classification accuracy.

## Dataset

The project uses the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (target variable with three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdurrayman21/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification
   jupyter notebook Iris-Flower-Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Run each cell in sequence to execute the full workflow, from data loading to evaluation and prediction.

## Model Performance

The Logistic Regression model achieves **[accuracy score placeholder]%** on the Iris dataset. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the confusion matrix providing insights into classification performance for each class.

## Results

The notebook concludes with a prediction example on test data, providing visual insights into the performance of the classification model on new data points.
